# sdwebui-freeU-extension
FreeU implementation for stable-diffusion-webui

Known issues : ControlNet hijacks UNet forward, so it has to be hijacked again.

Please use https://github.com/aria1th/sd-webui-controlnet/tree/test-freeU fork for contolnet + free Unet combination, if it is useful, I might make a pull request.
